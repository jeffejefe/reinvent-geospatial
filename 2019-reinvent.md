AWS hosts a variety of public datasets that anyone can access for free. Previously, large datasets such as satellite imagery or genomic data have required hours or days to locate, download, customize, and analyze. By making data available publicly on AWS, anyone can analyze any volume of data without needing to download or store it themselves. In this session, the AWS Open Data team shares tips and tricks, patterns and anti-patterns, and tools to help you most effectively stage your data for analysis in the cloud.

### [HAC201 - Code Green: Hacking on Amazon open sustainability data](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=99788&csrftkn=1DVK-VLXR-QY5Z-UCLL-BHAT-VQ4F-UUIN-DH7X)

Code Green invites you to enter a hackathon involving Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) datasets. Individual - or groups of two to five - hackers work on projects during re:Invent, with demos presented Thursday. Any ASDI dataset can be used. In particular, check out weather and climate. APIs, visualization tools, combinations of datasets into something new - all fair game. Entries should be open-source GitHub repos. Want to participate without competing? An ASDI workshop runs concurrently during the event Thursday. Code Green is purchasing carbon offsets for travel to re:Invent by all registered hackathon participants; hackathon winners receive free passes to re:Invent 2020. The real winner? Earth, of course.

### [WPS323 - Monitoring the Earth without costing the world](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=97783&csrftkn=1DVK-VLXR-QY5Z-UCLL-BHAT-VQ4F-UUIN-DH7X)

The BlueDot Water Observatory is an Earth-observation-based solution that provides reliable and timely information about surface water levels across the globe. Cost-effective yet reliable solutions for monitoring water resources are needed, as ground-based monitoring networks are often too costly and, in some cases, also unreliable. Sinergise shows how using global satellite imagery available on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) through the AWS Public Dataset Program, combined with an efficient use of services including AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon CloudWatch, you can carry out a global-scale project cheaper than previously possible.

### [STG352 - Edge computing in disaster response with Snowball Edge](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=97718&csrftkn=1DVK-VLXR-QY5Z-UCLL-BHAT-VQ4F-UUIN-DH7X)

Emergency personnel have to carefully coordinate their response to natural disasters across many teams. This coordination requires data, especially actionable mapping data. However, getting access to data at the tactical edge is challenging. In this session, we demonstrate an architecture and pipeline for managing data for field scenarios with the ruggedized AWS Snowball Edge. The serverless, cloud-based pipeline combines public and private data sources with open-source software that can be preloaded on Snowball Edge. See how it works firsthand, and ask questions to learn how you could put such edge computing to work in your field scenarios—even with drones.

### [STG353 - Edge computing, IoT & machine learning in disaster response](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=97722&csrftkn=1DVK-VLXR-QY5Z-UCLL-BHAT-VQ4F-UUIN-DH7X)

Many government agencies and commercial organizations come together to respond to natural disaster emergencies in the field. Such responders need computing resources at the tactical edge for communications, data gathering, and reconnaissance, often in dangerous or unstable environments. In this session, we discuss a solution architecture combining AWS Snowball Edge, IoT sensors, and C4ISR software that was deployed as the AWS Disaster Response Action team tested the tracking of search parties and recovery vehicles. We also demonstrate how machine learning at the edge can augment traditional sensor data to better support first responders and decision makers during disaster scenarios.

The first hour after a natural disaster is often referred to as the “golden hour," when responders have the highest chance of saving the lives of those effected by the disaster—but it's also when they have least amount of information available to them. In this chalk talk, we walk through different ways machine learning can help accelerate a responder’s understanding of the areas impacted and their ability to begin formulate potential recovery strategies. We also discuss how we leveraged Amazon SageMaker, In-Q-Tel’s SpaceNet dataset, Amazon Comprehend, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and much more to build the prototype solution.

### [SVS340-R - Serverless image processing workflows at scale with AWS Step Functions](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=96592&csrftkn=1DVK-VLXR-QY5Z-UCLL-BHAT-VQ4F-UUIN-DH7X)

With AWS Lambda, you can write code to process images and files without provisioning servers. But at scale, how do you coordinate multiple parallel processing steps, catch errors and retry failures, and keep your code modular and maintainable? AWS Step Functions comes to the rescue. In this workshop, you design and implement a distributed state machine to orchestrate a multi-step image recognition and processing workflow using Amazon Rekognition and AWS Step Functions.

### [AIM301-R - Creating high-quality training datasets with data labeling](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=95395&csrftkn=1DVK-VLXR-QY5Z-UCLL-BHAT-VQ4F-UUIN-DH7X)

Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth makes it easy to quickly label high-quality, accurate training datasets. In this workshop, we set up labeling jobs for text and images to help you understand how to make the most of Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth. You learn how to explore and prepare the dataset and label it with object bounding boxes. Then, we use Amazon SageMaker to train a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) object-detection model based on the labeled dataset, use hyperparameter optimization to find the best model for deployment, and deploy the model to an endpoint for use in an application.

### [ANT222-R - Analytics with Amazon Athena](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=97956&csrftkn=1DVK-VLXR-QY5Z-UCLL-BHAT-VQ4F-UUIN-DH7X)

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, and customers pay only for the queries they run. In this workshop, we dive deep into various use cases for Athena, including building applications that run on schedules, using CTAS and INSERT INTO as effective self-service ETL tools, and querying storage formats. We also look at authorization, authentication, and managing costs. If you are a data engineer looking to onboard your organization to Athena, this workshop equips you with the tools to be successful.
