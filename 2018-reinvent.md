In a short space of time, fast.ai has become a popular Deep Learning library, driven by the success of the fast.ai online Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). It has allowed SW developers to achieve, in the span of a few weeks, state-of-the-art results in domains such as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and structured data machine learning. In this chalk talk, we go into the details of building, training, and deploying fast.ai-based models using Amazon SageMaker.


### [WPS326 - AWS Public Data Sets: How to Stage Petabytes of Data for Analysis in AWS](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=90146)

[Video](#) | [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/aws-public-data-sets-how-to-stage-petabytes-of-data-for-analysis-in-aws-wps326-aws-reinvent-2018)

AWS hosts a variety of public data sets that anyone can access for free. Previously, large data sets such as satellite imagery or genomic data have required hours or days to locate, download, customize, and analyze. When data is made publicly available on AWS, anyone can analyze any volume of data without downloading or storing it themselves. In this session, the AWS Open Data Team shares tips and tricks, patterns and anti-patterns, and tools to help you effectively stage your data for analysis in the cloud.


### [WPS315 - National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency: Changing the Way the Intelligence Community Moves Data](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=90139)

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXelfBpJtDY) | [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/national-geospatialintelligence-agency-changing-the-way-the-intelligence-community-moves-data-wps315-aws-reinvent-2018)

In this session, we feature the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), a key stakeholder and sponsor for the new AWS Secret Region, which supports workloads up to the Secret U.S. security classification level and is readily available to the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). NGA uses AWS Snowball Edge to support War Fighter, utilizing imagery from NGA’s Open Data Store and implementing geospatial applications on the edge. AWS Snowball Edge allows NGA to directly support its mission, providing products and services to decision makers, warfighters, and first responders when they need it most. Enabling the edge changes NGA’s ability to share critical resources, data to facilitate user access meets NGA’s mission needs, and support the IC and Department of Defense as a whole.
